# logger

A **very** small logger wrapper to use with Pharo.

I act as a fa√ßade for the existing log system for ZnClient (and yes, it could collition with regular Zn 
events), but my intend is to simplify the access... and losing deepness, since I do not generate an event 
in particular for each case, but a simple log (info, error, debug).

Maybe I need to die and use a real logger, he :)

## Install
